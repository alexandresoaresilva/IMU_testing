The sensor errors of the tri-axis magnetometer (These errors are mainly due to machining and installation defects):

1. zero bias error:
The zero bias error makes constant offsets to each axis of the magnetometer, which is represented as a 3 × 1 vector, denoted as bzb. 

2. scale factor error:
The scale factor error comes from the sensitivity inconsistencies of each sensor. It is represented as 
a 3 × 3 diagonal matrix, denoted as Csf. The scale factor error comes from the sensitivity inconsistencies of each sensor. It is represented as a 3 × 3 diagonal matrix, denoted as Csf. The elements on the diagonal represent the sensitivities of each axis sensor. 


3. non-orthogonal error, 
The non-orthogonality between individual sensors introduces an inter-axis coupling output error, which is represented as a 3 × 3 upper triangular matrix, denoted as Cno. In general conditions of small angle errors, the diagonal elements of Cno are close to 1. 


4. misalignment error, and 
The misalignment error represents the angular misalignment between the tri-axis magnetometer set and the assembled platform, which is represented as a 3 × 3 unit rotation matrix, denoted as Cm. It can be simplified into an anti-symmetric matrix, with diagonal elements equal to 1.


5. noise. 
The output noise of individual sensor is assumed as uncorrelated Gaussian white noise. The output noise is represented as a 3 × 1 vector, denoted as e.
